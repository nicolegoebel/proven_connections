However, research shows the overarching emotions felt by people during the rehabilitation process are isolation, anxiety, loss of identity and low motivation. When you combine these challenges it leads to proven adherence rates to rehabilitation programs of 50%. These low adherence rates result in poor clinical and mental health outcomes for the individual, a greater burden on the healthcare system, and treatment challenges for practitioners who are already stretched for client time. At Brace, we understand that rehabilitation is an inherently mental, as well as physical, process. The Brace platform takes an industry leading approach to building for the physical and mental needs of the end user, and what supports their engagement and wellbeing. Through our innovative leveraging of social support and gamification, we're not only empowering improved engagement and wellbeing for the individual, but also driving increased efficiencies for practitioners and member organisations.

SiloSpi can monitor most solid and liquid materials including animal feed, polymers, biomass, molasses, cement, aggregates etc. Customers receive text / email alerts at pre-set low levels marks, to ensure against costly run-out. The need to climb silos to inspect levels is eliminated, enhancing health and safety.It is estimated that over €2 billion is wasted globally each year due to inefficient animal feed delivery. By providing mills with real-time data on feed levels in their customer’s bins, SiloSpi enables a more sustainable and efficient delivery process. Data driven, pro-active processes will reduce the amount of emergency deliveries and partial loads to farms. Reducing the amounts of trucks on the road will not only result in significant financial savings for mills, but will also add to their sustainability performance.","Using low cost sensors installed in the roof of a silo to capture levels data is the safest and most economical way to understand the quantity in tons of remaining material in your siloHowever, most level sensors struggle to survive in the harsh environment inside a silo, due the problem of dust and other contaminating material commonly found in a silo. Further a lot of level sensors incorporate moving parts in their operation which add complexity and can impact on long term reliability. SiloSpi, is the only sensor option on the market with the capability to deal with these dust and contaminant issue, that exists in all silos, and to do so without any moving parts whatsoever. Unlike many other competitor solutions, once installed, we can maintain the product from the bottom of the silo, saving time, effort and the risk associated with climbing the silo. LVLogics SiloSpi monitor has a wide operational temperature range and can be fitted with an all - weather cap, to ensure it will work in extreme climates found anywhere in the world.SiloSpi is a market disrupter solution due to it being the:Only low-cost solution that fits ALL silos sizes with consistent accuracyOnly top-down sensor with on-ground maintenance featuresOnly Self-Cleaning solution with no moving partsOnly solution with solar powered optioningOnly solution with optional in-silo temperature &amp.; humidity sensorComplexity is based in the cloud rather than the hardware located on the silo which allows for over-the-air upgradesOnly monitor that uses to provide for wireless operationOnly monitor with and Extreme Weather Enclosure option",https://d3bddsqeatnr0e.cloudfront.net/brochures/SiloSpi_Flyer.pdf,"Ballyhist, Carnaross, Kells,","Eileen Finnegan - eileen@lvlogics.com, Barry Finnegan - barry@lvlogics.com",,"Callan Co-Op (callancoop.ie), Cargill (cargill.com), CARLOW FOODS LTD (carlowfoods.ie), CONDRON CONCRETE LTD (condronconcrete.com), Dairygold (dairygold.ie), Floatingfarm (floatingfarm.nl), ForFarmers UK Ltd (forfarmers.co.uk), Irish Prison Service (irishprisons.ie), Kiernan Milling (kiernanmilling.ie), Manor Farm (chicken.ie), Motion Controls International (motioncontrols.com), NWF Agriculture (nwf.co.uk), Ophardt Ltd (ophardt.com), Pat Denn Agriculture (denn.ie), QUINNS OF BALTINGLASS LTD (quinns.ie), Rampf Machine Systems (rampf-group.com), SIAC (siac.ie), SOUTHERN MILLING LTD (southernmilling.ie), UCD Lyons Farms (ucd.ie), Wellman International (wellman-intl.com), WICKLOW WOLF BREWING CO LTD (wicklowwolf.com), Wooodford Millling Co ()","Chemicals,Dairy,Farming,Food & Beverages,Logistics and Supply Chain,Manufacturing,Mining & Metals,Renewables & Environment,Construction,Agriculture,Alternative Energy,Animal Health,Energy,Horticulture,Sustainability,Waste Management,Wood Industry,Equine",Smart Farm Solutions,100,24/05/2024 13:24,16/09/2024 08:22,"Afrikaans, English, German, Japanese",no,-,24/05/2024 13:24,no

Beverly Hills Formula is the only Irish brand providing premium quality oral care products for the oral health and beauty sector, through their range of whitening toothpastes, mouthwashes and oral care products, to help you achieve that all important “Hollywood” smile. The brand was established in 1992 in Ireland thanks to the high quality of the waters, resources and skillful personnel available there. The products, previously manufactured in Bray Co. Wicklow, are now manufactured in Milan, Italy. Back in the early 1990s, the majority of whitening toothpastes had very high levels of abrasivity that were responsible for mouth sensitivity and damage to the tooth enamel. Beverly Hills Formula saw a gap in the market and thus provided a solution to this problem. Combining leading scientific advancements and finest ingredients, they created a toothpaste which provided high stain removal and whitening effect without damaging the enamel. The combination of the most innovative ingredients from both Europe and North America lead to the development of the chemical formula, which together with the famous high quality waters of Co. Wicklow in Ireland, resulted in the first product Total Protection Whitening toothpaste launching in 1993. The product shot to success and was soon followed by Sensitive Whitening toothpaste which alongside with making teeth whiter reduces sensitivity. The Beverly Hills Formula products are a cost-effective way to achieve a whiter smile and were the first brand in the UK to introduce its Money Back Guarantee system, which is still honoured to this day. The Perfect White range launched in 2012 with the first two products Perfect White and Perfect White Sensitive.

Unique Feature of Self Erectors A Self Erecting Tower Crane is a tower crane which arrives on site ready assembled but folded. Self Erecting tower cranes are predominantly operated through radio remote control, this leaves the operator free to move around the site and therefore maximize the efficiency of the equipment. Self Erecting Tower cranes can operate in very confined spaces, SETC footprint is approximately 4.5m x 4.5m The Mantis Way At Mantis Cranes we strive not only to meet customer expectations but to exceed them. Our consultative led sales process is tailored to each individual customer in order to meet their unique requirements. We are certified with ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 accreditation's, health and safety is at the core of all our operations. Mantis cranes also manufacture the cranes which provide us with expertise to assist and assurances of quality standards. The breadth of our expertise and geographical reach across the UK results that we are engaged in a broad range of project types ranging from the relatively small timber frame housing project or larger commercial build. Our ethos at Mantis Cranes has been and remains that “we find the right crane for the job, not a job for the crane”. Self erectors have steadily grown in popularity for a combination of factors such as speed and ease of installation, and the ability to fold back the Jib which offers a practical solution to over sail issues. The Mantis approach is not simply about crane hire, Mantis provide expert advice which ranges from best location to place the crane onsite, right through to training and induction with crane to recommending accessories which utilize on-site operations.",,,,,,,,,0,29/11/2023 11:30,,,no,-,29/11/2023 11:30,no

It was not unusual for customers to wait while mashed potato was piped on top of the shepherd’s pie or while a roulade was rolled and they would go home happy in the knowledge that the food had just come out of the oven. Four years later, Mount Merrion was thriving and it was the right time to open a second location, this time in Donnybrook. A little second hand red Peugeot van delivered the food daily from Blackrock. Catering was provided for big and busy companies, dinner parties, christenings, birthdays, anniversaries and more, all serviced from the little kitchen at the back of a shop. The business was growing very quickly and there was great demand for what was being done. As more and more shops were opened, there was a need for a bigger kitchen space.

1950,KILLARNEY TELECOMMUNICATIONS LTD,ktl.ie,,"Whilst KTL now has offices in Ireland (Naas) and across the UK (Manchester, Reading and Birmingham), the company made a humble debut, launching from the bedroom of civil engineer Tony Killarney. Originally the company was called Killarney Telecommunications Limited, which was later shortened to KTL. In 1998, mobile network roll outs were accelerating across Ireland and the UK and a surge in the building of housing estates was driving heavy demand for power and utilities services. Digifone – which would later become O2 then Telefonica and is now Three - became KTL’s first client. In 2010, KTL entered the UK market, broadening its professional services, telecoms, power and utilities business. Moving with the rapid pace of the telecommunications industry, the company has evolved from simple civil engineering to the deeply technical side of network engineering, completing end-to-end managed services for clients with full planning, design, network build and integration, upgrade and maintenance. Today KTL still takes inspiration from its history, reflecting on the fact that we have never failed to deliver a project and always strive to live up to that record. We are also constantly looking forward, and performing better, while being a great place to work with excellent benefits and a progressive culture.",,,,,,,,,0,05/12/2023 10:28,,,no,-,05/12/2023 10:28,no

176,FLO-FAST,flofast.com,,"FLO-FAST was conceived after a fuel spill at a race track. Thus, early on FLO-FAST was developed as a safe and easy way to transfer fuel into and out of race cars. The inventor, Norman Franks, was at a race track getting ready to fuel up before a test session. He had his funnel and fuel container ready to pour, but as the fuel began to pour the funnel tipped and fuel went everywhere. There was gasoline all over the inside of the roll cage and on the seat cushion. It was a mess and a huge hassle.On the way home from the race track, Norman determined to figure out a safe and fool-proof way to fuel a race car. Two years later he had conceived of, invented, tested and was close to bringing a product solution to market. FLO-FAST was launched in 2006 at the Performance Industry Trade show in Orlando Florida.In the first two years of business, the focus was on the racing and motorsports markets. There was an immediate need and racers were going to be quick to see the merits of the product, adapt quickly and use FLO-FAST. As the company grew, so did the requests from customers who had boats, ATVs, commercial businesses, farms to run, etc. With all of these new market requests, there was a need for more storage capacity, which pushed FLO-FAST to invest in tools to make larger containers – 7.5, 10.5 and 15-gallon sizes. As the containers sizes got larger, we needed to come up with a way to transport them, so the Versa Cart was developed to hold up to 21 gallons. Today we have pumps, containers and a cart to transport and transfer all different types of fuels, water, and even harsh chemicals safely and easily.Over the years, we have had a host of requests from our customers for accessories that would make their fluid transfer operations even easier. Product Development Group listened and began producing a full line of accessory items that are purchased with the majority of the FLO-FAST systems we sell.And here we are today! Now we have 95 active dealers, 10 regional and national retailers in the United States, along with distribution in the United Kingdom, France, Finland, Australia, Canada. It has been an amazing journey thus far and Product Development Group intends to take FLO-FAST into the future with continued research and development to insure we have a superior fluid transfer system and related products to meet our customers’ needs.",Our mission is simple at Product Development Group.

Language Therapy service that, over the last 25 years, has only been available through 1:1 private consultancy. It is for age ranges from 6 years to adult and it offers a very affordable opportunity for a schoolchild to learn to ""read &amp. spell"" competently in the English language. It has results-based evidence for improving reading and spelling skills in as little as 16 weeks. It is being used successfully by parents, teachers and other educational professionals. Mainstream schools are now introducing WordsWorthLearning© as part of their literacy strategy. Parents can take independent action to resolve their child's reading and spelling skills by using the programme at home. Interestingly it has introduced a ""collaborative” approach, because it can be shared between a teacher, parent and student allowing them to work together to improve the student's reading/spelling skills.The programme is ready made for the ever growing “Flipped Classroom” model, because it contains 104 streamed video tutorials and 330 interactive exercises. Most children with reading and spelling difficulties are continually failing at school, never reaching their true academic potential. Using WordsWorthLearning© collaboratively or individually gives them the opportunity to learn to read and spell in their own time and at their own pace.

Almost 30 years later, the nutrient-rich milk from the family farm is still the core ingredient for the ice cream, cheesecakes, as well as the fillings and finishes for its baked desserts.

We achieve serious cost reductions and operational efficiencies by making it possible for everyone to securely manage video – from less-technical marketers to highly technical IT administrators. The Problem #1: Storage Almost all video is now shot in HD or 4K. Put in context – a single 30 second commercial can produce 1hour of content rushes – 200+ GB of data – more data than can be stored on most laptops. The Problem #2: Sharing and collaborating: Currently, video content owners are using memory sticks, portable hard drives, dropbox, wetransfer and a number of other unsuitable consumer tools used to share and collaborate on video content. The result is that it’s time consuming and inefficient. What Overcast does: Overcast works with marketers, production companies, agencies, creatives and large video content owners to securely store, share and collaborate on their video content. We solve production bottlenecks. Because video files are so big and difficult to move around, it restricts how many can be made. We make it easy to scale the amount of video created. Overcast has signed partnerships with Amazon, Signiant and the Digital Production Partnership. A number of tech partnerships are pending. The Client Opportunity: Overcast is actively on-boarding new clients who want to scale their video operations, save money and increase sales.",,,,,,,,Sports Tech & Sporting Goods,25,26/07/2024 16:58,,,no,-,26/07/2024 16:58,no

3572,Tolerant Networks,tolerantnetworks.com,"Space,Ground Station Systems and Networks","Tolerant Networks was founded in April 2010 by Stephen Farrell and Kerry Hartnett. The company was spun out of an EU FP7 funded project called N4C in which we used Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) to enable Internet-like communications in very remote communities. We have successfully completed a range of projects in the area of DTN deployment, educational DTN projects and DTN usage for the European Space Agency. More recently we have been involved with EU funded projects working with nlnet.nl on EU funded NGI Zero projects. We are also working on ECH Encrypted ClientHello mechanism that plugs a few privacy holes in TLS. We are working with guardain project with funding from Open Technology FundDr. Stephen Farrell is a research fellow in the Distributed Systems Group of the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin, (academic home page) where he teaches and researches on security and delay/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN), and in 2006 co-authored the first book on the latter topic. Stephen has been involved in Internet standards for more than a decade - currently (Feb 2017) he is just finishing up six years as IETF security area director. Prior to returning to academia in 2002, Stephen had 15 years experience in industry, working for Siemens and Baltimore Technologies amongst others.With over 20 years experience in IT Kerry Hartnett is an experienced and versatile senior IT professional. Kerry worked with Intel for 15 years in all aspects of IT. Commercially aware and results-orientated with a wide range of technical abilities, Kerry's planning and organisational skills have enabled him to repeatedly deliver complex integration projects to schedule. Kerry has a BSc. in Information Systems and is currently working on contract as a research engineer on the N4C project. Kerry's current focus is on new technology deployment in networks and research.Dr. Niall O’Reilly joined Tolerant Networks Ltd in 2015 after more than three decades of experience, mainly in IT Services at University College Dubin (UCD), where he worked in customer support, system administration, and service planning and management. In the period before the Internet, Niall built a continental X.25 network for the European Academic and Research Network (EARN).

However, companies’ ability to leverage that data is being continuously squeezed by privacy regulations and business risks associated with sharing sensitive information. Prior to 2020, only 10% of the world’s population were protected by modern data regulations. By 2023, this number will grow to 65%, affecting 80% of multinational organisations. Despite this, in a recent study, 91% of software engineers failed to implement simple privacy solutions due to a lack of either experience, knowledge or means to verify their work. The ability for organisations to balance data privacy and strategic insights will be the largest commercial advantage of this decade. Building privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) has traditionally been extremely expensive, resource-intensive and scaled poorly. Instead, Oblivious has taken a refreshing new approach - focusing on low code interfaces to design secure APIs for multi-party computation, engage stakeholders and ultimately save on costs, resources and technology risk. These interfaces operate in analogy to Docker that revolutionized the portability of software by allowing the developer to focus on what they need, not how it is deployed on a specific OS or hardware.

635,LITTLE POND LIMITED,prommt.com,,"Prommt is a leading SaaS platform that enables businesses to request, collect and track remote payments from their customers with secure, personalised, merchant-branded payment links that can be sent via email, text as well as from within chat and messaging apps. Customers are given the choice to pay by card or instant account-to-account bank transfer (Pay by Bank) that leverages open banking capabilities. Prommt is perfect for businesses that cannot easily transact online due to the product or service being too bespoke or custom to lend itself to self-selection, and is particularly relevant for luxury retail, hospitality, automotive, builders merchants and professional services sectors.Many merchants in the industries mentioned above often accept payments over the phone, which renders their business susceptible to costly chargebacks and card fraud, especially when sensitive details are transmitted and stored insecurely. Additionally, they run the risks of data breaches, high payment operations &amp.; card processing costs, and a poor customer shopping experience.Prommt enables such merchants to reduce costs and protect margins by supplementing in-store or over the phone consultations with an easy, secure and more convenient way to pay. Industry leaders such as Selfridges, Bulgari, Chelsea FC, Bowker, Harvey Norman, Adare Manor, Ballyfin Demense and many others use Prommt to drive profitability by significantly reducing card fraud &amp.; chargebacks, minimising payment administration, and delivering a remote buying experience that reflects their brand identity.","Prommt is more than a basic pay by link solution.

Payments made through Pay by Bank are conducted using PSD2/open banking protocols, and protected by industry-standard banking security.4. Prommt’s Pay by Bank delivers significant savings on payment operations costs and reduces revenue leakage due to card fraud &amp.; chargebacks. Many of our clients favour bank payments over card, indicating a huge sway towards the desire to eliminate card fees, reduce fraud and collect instant account-to-account payments. Pay by Bank is bringing more high-value transactions onto our platform, with many customers utilising our solution to replace cumbersome bank transfers and card payments.5.

Contact us for a no-obligation chat about your next project.","We believe there are many reasons to work with us, but here’s our top 10!Sustainability: We lead the way in sustainable and environmental design. We shape local authority policy and tailor carbon management plans to our clients' needs, putting sustainability at the core of our designs.Heat Network Specialists: We have a strong track record of technical excellence in the heat network and decarbonization sectors. We have pioneered many of the best practice principles in these areas. Our expertise includes optimizing central plant operations, addressing site power challenges, liaising with DNO, considering network temperatures, providing prefabricated packaged plant solutions, implementing fabric interventions, and possessing in-depth knowledge of existing and emerging technologies such as ASHPs, WSHPs, GSHPs, etc.Commercial Acumen: We consistently assume a pivotal commercial control role in our projects, carefully evaluating CAPEX, OPEX, and life cycle cost, while actively seeking out optioneering and value engineering opportunities to ensure our clients receive the utmost value. Furthermore, we expertly manage crucial cost-related project elements, including budget preparation, funding applications, tender analysis, contractor selection, and contractor valuations.Project Management: While our technical ability and engineering expertise are sources of pride, we also excel in the role of overall project manager, overseeing the design team, including the architect, structural engineer, and planning consultant. This is particularly relevant for projects with a focus on MEP and/or decarbonization, such as heat network installations, where we can ensure efficient and successful outcomes.International Accreditation: We are proud to be certified and registered with esteemed international professional institutions such as CIBSE, showcasing our unparalleled technical expertise in this field.Design Rationalisation: At the core of our work is practical and pragmatic engineering. We firmly reject over-engineering and instead prioritize the application of best-practice design principles such as size optimization, storage optimization, flow and temperature optimization, and appropriate usage diversity. This approach guarantees that our proposed solutions are precisely tailored to the task at hand, enabling installations to function at peak efficiency while keeping CAPEX expenditure to a minimum.BIM Expertise: We take pride in our extensive in-house BIM team with expertise across all RIBA stages, from concept to handover. Our diverse client base includes developers, local authorities, contractors, and building operators, allowing us to accumulate best-in-class BIM knowledge. We have the in-house abilities to produce the most detailed 3D modelling information.Strategic Delivery Expertise: In the decarbonization and heat network sectors, our projects are executed on live sites, where maintaining regular business operations is essential to our clients. This is particularly critical in healthcare settings such as hospitals. With our expertise, we have successfully managed live projects under demanding operational conditions and can offer ""Keep Live"" design solutions to minimize or eliminate disruptions to day-to-day site operations.Delivering and Verifying Operational Savings: Maximizing energy and carbon savings during the design phase is essential, but ensuring these savings are realized during the operational phase is just as critical. Our rigorous witness testing before handover guarantees that the systems are installed according to design specifications and commissioned in adherence to best practices. Additionally, we provide support for measuring and verifying the actual savings during the operational phase.‘Big Picture’ Thinking: As design engineers, we possess the unique ability to zoom out from the finer details and focus on the broader aspects of a project when needed. By consistently evaluating project outputs in alignment with the overall project objectives, we ensure that we deliver maximum value to our clients, prioritizing their overarching goals over minor elements.",https://d3bddsqeatnr0e.cloudfront.net/brochures/IN2_ExpoReal_Brochure_1022.pdf,"IN2 Engineering Unit E&F, Mountpleasant Business Centre Mountpleasant Ave Upper Ranelagh Dublin, D06 P5N8, Ireland","Lorraine Kenny - lorraine.kenny@in2.ie, Graeme Parker - graeme@in2.ie, Emma Thompson - emma.thompson@in2engineering.com",,"Beaumont Hospital (beaumont.ie), Collen Construction (collen.com), Linesight (linesight.com)","Architecture & Planning,Commercial Real Estate,Environmental Services,Healthcare,Hospitality,Leisure, Travel & Tourism,Museums and Institutions,Pharmaceuticals,Renewables & Environment,Retail,Warehousing,Wellness and Fitness,Data Centres,Construction",Construction,62,05/12/2023 10:51,03/07/2024 15:48,,no,-,05/12/2023 10:51,no

1923,GLENILEN FARM LTD,glenilenfarm.com,,"Alan and Valerie Kingston are the driving force behind Glenilen Farm, an artisan, dairy-based food manufacturing business based in West Cork. When Valerie began to make and sell homemade cheesecakes at the local Farmers’ Market, using milk from the couple’s dairy farm in Drimoleague back in 1997, little did she know that within 23 years, what began as a kitchen-table business would develop in to the hugely successful food development and manufacturing concern that it is today. Having quickly realised the increase in return that could be achieved by processing their milk into cheese, cream, and dairy-based desserts which could be sold directly to the customer, the couple invested in the construction of a dedicated production unit on their West-Cork farm in 2002.

2269,TETHRAS TECHNOLOGY LTD,tethras.com,,"Tethras makes it extremely easy for app developers to localize their apps. And we make it even easier to maintain these localizations in future versions. Simply upload your resource files from your Xcode project via ZIP file upload or via SVN integration. We process your files, generate pseudo-translations for you to test and provide instant quotes in over 40 languages. Accepting your purchase request, we then send your content out to our highly skilled network of human translators. Our translators use a Tethras client app called TILT (Tethras Interactive Localization Tool) that allows them to adjust buttons and text objects that invariably need resizing after translation. TILT runs on Mac, Windows or Linux. We think this is pretty neat. Days, weeks or months after you have released your app in multiple languages, and you have just fixed a bug, or added a new feature, upload your latest English resource files to Tethras. The system can detect any changes since the last time we delivered localized content to you. Instant price quotes for your existing languages, and quotes for any new languages you might want to add to the mix are generated. We are all about supporting the continuous development process. We understand the frequency at which apps are developed, released and updated. We understand that localization is a time consuming process. We understand this because we are developers too.

John J identified the opportunity to pioneer a steel fabrication business, its principal objective to meet a growing demand for the supply and erection of steel buildings in the agricultural sector. In the early 1960’s the company began trading as O’Dwyer Steel Co. Ltd and continued to break new ground with the expansion into the commercial and industrial sectors. John J O’Dwyer and his family maintained their association with the business until the 1990’s, by which time the company was the leading supplier of farm buildings in the Munster region. On July 27th 2000 the O’Dwyer family accepted an ownership buyout of the business from the current Company Board of Directors Sean Dalton, Matt Ryan and John Hanly. The new management structure recognised that the O’Dwyer Steel brand was perceived as a primarily agricultural building enterprise.
